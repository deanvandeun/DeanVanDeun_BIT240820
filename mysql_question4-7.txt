# Question 4
# Give the name and length of the smallest gene in the genome.

query = select gene_name, (seq_region_end - seq_region_start +1) as length from gene order by length limit 1;

name = TRDD1
length = 8

# Question 5
# Give the name of the gene with the most transcripts.
# Give to number of transcripts of this gene.


query = select gene_name, count(transcript.gene_id) as count from gene, transcript where gene.gene_id = transcript.gene_id group by gene_name order by count desc limit 1;
name = U6
number of transcripts = 1329

# Question 6
# Give the name of the chromosome with the second most genes that tell something about cancer.
# What is the number of exons of this chromosome?
# Two queries

query 1 = select chromosome, count(*) as total_genes from gene where description = "cancer" group by chromosome order by total_genes desc limit 1 offset 1;

chromosome = 2
total number of genes = 3852

query 2 =


# Question 7
# Give the number of rows from the exon table and do the same for the exon_transcript table.
# Explain why there is a difference in the number of rows.

# see if all exon_ids are only present once:

query = select exon_id, count(*) as number from exon group by exon_id order by number desc limit 10;

# this is the case

query = selection exon_id from exon;
number of rows = 642 590

# repeat for exon_transcript table

# this is also the case

query = select exon_id from transcript_exon;
number of rows = 1 178 393
